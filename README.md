# WordPress Plugin Collection by Elif Eda SelÃ§uk

This repository contains a set of simple yet practical WordPress plugins I developed to explore plugin architecture, localization, and user experience enhancement opportunities from both a technical and product perspective.

As a Product Manager with a technical background, I believe that understanding the internal logic of extensible platforms like WordPress is critical for building user-centric, scalable, and localized digital experiences.
